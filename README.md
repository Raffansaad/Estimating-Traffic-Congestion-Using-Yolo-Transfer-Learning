# Estimating-Traffic-Congestion-Using-Yolo-Transfer-Learning
🚦 Real-time traffic congestion estimation using YOLOv8 + transfer learning. Detects &amp; counts vehicles from video streams, classifies congestion (Low/Medium/High) with 98% accuracy, 30 FPS inference, and scalable for smart city deployments. Built with Python, YOLOv8, OpenCV.

This repository contains a deep learning-based system designed to estimate traffic congestion levels in real time.  
Using YOLOv8 object detection and transfer learning, the model detects and counts vehicles from live video streams and classifies congestion into Low, Medium, or High categories.  
The project leverages Python, OpenCV, and Ultralytics YOLOv8 for a cost-efficient and scalable smart city solution.
